## Teaching material for an introductory course on Python

### TODO
- More info about the workings of Spyder in lecture slides: e.g., explain red stop button within a while loop, execute cells, 
- Practicals during afternoon session
- Better introductory exercises on `bool`s and data types
- Remove `__file__` variable and replace by proper file path. The `__file__` path gives problems in Spyder when running execute cells
- Indexing errors in the matplotlib slides when talking about grid objects
